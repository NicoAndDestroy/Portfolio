				I love to be able to imagine something and be able to carry it out thanks to technology, thanks to my experience talking to various cultures of the world I could expand my vision and broaden my horizons, I love music and learn empirically, I strongly believe that when you make a mistake you are closer to success than failure, that's what life is all about.
